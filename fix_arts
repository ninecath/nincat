# VERSION:
#   2.0
#
# DESCRIPTION:
#   This scripts will update the names of all the ASCII arts with their current
#   columns and rows size, this will NOT alter the files, just their names.
#   If a file is not with the correct number of columns, it will warn you.
#
#   It will look for art that can be loaded in the terminal size.
#   So I do recommend you to have multiple arts.
#
#   If you want nincat to print faster, then just use a POSIX-compliant shell,
#   I do recommend dash (which as 4x faster than bash).
#
# NOTE:
#   See section 'ADDING NEW ASCII ARTS' of README.md
