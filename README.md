## üåü Features:
+ Fast as it can be and lightweight;
+ Self adapt with the terminal size to print only ASCII arts that fit;
+ Supports **lolcat** arts (if there's more programs like **lolcat**, we can support it, too :)
+ Supports HEX colour foreground/background arts and 256 colours, 88 colours, 16 colours;
+ Skip empty ASCII art files;
+ You can select an art directly (by option);
+ List all ASCII art's paths (by option);
+ Print the name of printed art (by option);
+ We'll always give you more, baby!
+ Use modular list of ASCCI arts with the paths to be faster (by option you can update).

## ‚ö° Installing

### Arch Linux (Manjaro, Artix, Arco...)

With an AUR helper, you can install it with the package called `nincat-git`.
Example with [paru](https://github.com/Morganamilo/paru):

```zsh
paru -S nincat-git
nincat random
```

### By Github

Click in `Code` in this repository and then `Download ZIP`. Extract it using your favourite tool and then in your terminal: 
```zsh
cd PUT_HERE_THE_PATH_OF_NINCAT
make
nincat random
```

### By Git

From your terminal, you can clone in your preferred folder:
```zsh
git clone 'https://github.com/ninecath/nincat'
cd nincat
make
nincat random
```

### Loading it

Probably you want to put when your Terminal opens, that is, when your shell is loaded. If you don't care a lot about shells, you probably use `bash`, maybe `zsh` with `Oh my zsh`.
Anyway, all you need to do is add this line in your shell **rc** changing the location for `nincat` script, then you'll be able to load it when the terminal opens :)
To verify what shell you use, run `echo $SHELL` in your terminal.

+ For `zsh` the	rc is put in `~/.zshrc`;
+ For `bash` the rc is put in `~/.bashrc`;
+ For `fish` the config is put in `~/.config/fish/config.fish`;
+ etc... search for the documentation of your shell if it isn't listed here.

```zsh
nincat random
```

**TIP**: Faster is better, if you have the `dash` shell installed in your machine, consider using it (it's 4x faster than bash and considered the fastest shell) with the following line:
```zsh
which nincat
dash LOCATION_OF_NINCAT random
```

In **Arch Linux (...based ditros)** you can use `pacman -S dash` to install it.

I'd recommend, too, you putting the line in the top of your shell.

## Options

Tree of arguments:

+ `--random` or `-r` : print a random ASCII arts that fits in your terminal;
  - `--see` or `-s` : prints the path of the ASCII art that it finds.
+ `--list` or `-l` : print the path of all ASCII arts;
+ `--view` or `-v` : view an ASCII art;
  - `[path_of_file]` : the path of the ASCII art (use **list** in doubt).
+ `--help` or `-h` : help list of commands;
+ `--update` or `-u` : update the file list with all the arts.

----

## üò™ Dependencies:
+ **lolcat** (optional)
  - [Please, use its faster implantation](https://github.com/jaseg/lolcat)
  - So, if you want to, you can disable this dependency by just removing the `ascii_arts/lolcat` folder in the root directory of `nincat`. And if you know a little bit of shell scripting, remove its condition on the script file.

## ‚úèÔ∏è  Adding new ASCII arts:

File names are made in this format: `<name-of-art> <rows-size-of-art> <columns-size-of-art>`. **Yes, it does contain spaces, do not forget it, it's important!** They are put in the `/ascii_arts/`. You can make a separate folder to add your own arts.

Things to do while creating a new art:
+ Each line without trailing spaces at the end;
+ Use spaces (DO NOT USE TABS!!!);

Please, do not fill all the lines with spaces to close all columns. A good and simple example should be:
```
# Your wonderful username/name and/or extra information
   (   )
: ) o_o ( :
```

**Please, run the `fix_ascii_arts` script if you want to make sure your file is correctly put!**

Because If you do not want to count the rows and columns of your file, just run the update script called `/fix_ascii_arts` in the root path.
If you added colours on you art, remember that you do not have to put a' reset colour' after it. nincat will do that for you.

##### Colours

[Give a look at this site for **256, 88, 16 colours** in your ASCII arts](https://misc.flogisoft.com/bash/tip_colors_and_formatting).
And obviously, you should utilize `\033` instead of `\e`.

For **true colours**, [I'd recommend this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4842424/list-of-ansi-color-escape-sequences).

### üíû Please, contribute!

It would be lovely that for every art you add, you add it here, too! Remember to put your name in the first line, so your contribution is never forgotten :)

#### By Github's Pull Request (recommended)

Clone this project, add your art in a file in either manually with **Github** or with **git**, then send a pull request here comparing both branches.

#### By Github's Issue

Create a new issue in the `New art` option and put there your art.

#### Literally email (not recommended, please)

Send an email to `koetemagie@gmail.com` with your art, do not forget to put your name in the first line and email. If you forgot, I will add it for you :)
